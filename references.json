    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy is a key driver of discoveries in the life sciences, with observable phenomena being limited by the optics of the microscope, the chemistry of the fluorophores, and the maximum photon exposure tolerated by the sample. These limits necessitate trade-offs between imaging speed, spatial resolution, light exposure, and imaging depth. In this work we show how content-aware image restoration based on deep learning extends the range of biological phenomena observable by microscopy. We demonstrate on eight concrete examples how microscopy images can be restored even if 60-fold fewer photons are used during acquisition, how near isotropic resolution can be achieved with up to tenfold under-sampling along the axial direction, and how tubular and granular structures smaller than the diffraction limit can be resolved at 20-times-higher frame rates compared to state-of-the-art methods. All developed image restoration methods are freely available as open source software in Python, FIJI, and KNIME.",

Accurate segmentation of individual cells in images enables exploration of complex biological questions, but can require sophisticated imaging processing pipelines in cases of low contrast and high object density. Deep learning-based methods are considered state-of-the-art for image segmentation but typically require vast amounts of annotated data, for which there is no suitable resource available in the field of label-free cellular imaging. Here, we present LIVECell, a large, high-quality, manually annotated and expert-validated dataset of phase-contrast images, consisting of over 1.6 million cells from a diverse set of cell morphologies and culture densities. To further demonstrate its use, we train convolutional neural network-based models using LIVECell and evaluate model segmentation accuracy with a proposed a suite of benchmarks.</jats:p>",

This has been a major factor limiting insight into the complex variability of cellular environments. Modern EM can produce gigavoxel image volumes containing large numbers of cells, but accurate manual segmentation of image features is slow and limits the creation of cell models. Segmentation algorithms based on convolutional neural networks can process large volumes quickly, but achieving EM task accuracy goals often challenges current techniques. Here, we define <jats:italic>dense cellular segmentation</jats:italic> as a multiclass semantic segmentation task for modeling cells and large numbers of their organelles, and give an example in human blood platelets. We present an algorithm using novel hybrid 2D–3D segmentation networks to produce dense cellular segmentations with accuracy levels that outperform baseline methods and approach those of human annotators. To our knowledge, this work represents the first published approach to automating the creation of cell models with this level of structural detail.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Despite the intimate link between cell organization and function, the principles underlying intracellular organization and the relation between organization, gene expression and phenotype are not well understood. We address this by creating a benchmark for mean cell organization and the natural range of cell-to-cell variation. This benchmark can be used for comparison to other normal or abnormal cell states. To do this, we developed a reproducible microscope imaging pipeline to generate a high-quality dataset of 3D, high-resolution images of over 200,000 live cells from 25 isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines from the Allen Cell Collection. Each line contains one fluorescently tagged protein, created via endogenous CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, representing a key cellular structure or organelle. We used these images to develop a new multi-part and generalizable analysis approach of the locations, amounts, and variation of these 25 cellular structures. Taking an integrated approach, we found that both the extent to which a structure’s individual location varied (“stereotypy”) and the extent to which the structure localized relative to all the other cellular structures (“concordance”) were robust to a wide range of cell shape variation, from flatter to taller, smaller to larger, or less to more polarized cells. We also found that these cellular structures varied greatly in how their volumes scaled with cell and nuclear size. These analyses create a data-driven set of quantitative rules for the locations, amounts, and variation of 25 cellular structures within the hiPSC as a normal baseline for cell organization.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A continuing challenge in quantitative cell biology is the accurate and robust 3D segmentation of structures of interest from fluorescence microscopy images in an automated, reproducible, and widely accessible manner for subsequent interpretable data analysis. We describe the Allen Cell and Structure Segmenter (Segmenter), a Python-based open source toolkit developed for 3D segmentation of cells and intracellular structures in fluorescence microscope images. This toolkit brings together classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows first to generate initial high-quality 3D intracellular structure segmentations and then to easily curate these results to generate the ground truths for building robust and accurate deep learning models. The toolkit takes advantage of the high-replicate 3D live cell image data collected at the Allen Institute for Cell Science of over 30 endogenous fluorescently tagged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. Each cell line represents a different intracellular structure with one or more distinct localization patterns within undifferentiated hiPS cells and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. The Segmenter consists of two complementary elements, a classic image segmentation workflow with a restricted set of algorithms and parameters and an iterative deep learning segmentation workflow. We created a collection of 20 classic image segmentation workflows based on 20 distinct and representative intracellular structure localization patterns as a “lookup table” reference and starting point for users. The iterative deep learning workflow can take over when the classic segmentation workflow is insufficient. Two straightforward “human-in-the-loop” curation strategies convert a set of classic image segmentation workflow results into a set of 3D ground truth images for iterative model training without the need for manual painting in 3D. The deep learning model architectures used in this toolkit were designed and tested specifically for 3D fluorescence microscope images and implemented as readable scripts. The Segmenter thus leverages state of the art computer vision algorithms in an accessible way to facilitate their application by the experimental biology researcher.</jats:p><jats:p>We include two useful applications to demonstrate how we used the classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows to solve more challenging 3D segmentation tasks. First, we introduce the ‘Training Assay’ approach, a new experimental-computational co-design concept to generate more biologically accurate segmentation ground truths. We combined the iterative deep learning workflow with three Training Assays to develop a robust, scalable cell and nuclear instance segmentation algorithm, which could achieve accurate target segmentation for over 98% of individual cells and over 80% of entire fields of view. Second, we demonstrate how to extend the lamin B1 segmentation model built from the iterative deep learning workflow to obtain more biologically accurate lamin B1 segmentation by utilizing multi-channel inputs and combining multiple ML models. The steps and workflows used to develop these algorithms are generalizable to other similar segmentation challenges. More information, including tutorials and code repositories, are available at allencell.org/segmenter.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is a cutting-edge volumetric imaging technique that allows for three-dimensional imaging of mesoscopic samples with decoupled illumination and detection paths. Although the selective excitation scheme of such a microscope provides intrinsic optical sectioning that minimizes out-of-focus fluorescence background and sample photodamage, it is prone to light absorption and scattering effects, which results in uneven illumination and striping artifacts in the images adversely. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a blind stripe artifact removal algorithm in LSFM, called DeStripe, which combines a self-supervised spatio-spectral graph neural network with unfolded Hessian prior. Specifically, inspired by the desirable properties of Fourier transform in condensing striping information into isolated values in the frequency domain, DeStripe firstly localizes the potentially corrupted Fourier coefficients by exploiting the structural difference between unidirectional stripe artifacts and more isotropic foreground images. Affected Fourier coefficients can then be fed into a graph neural network for recovery, with a Hessian regularization unrolled to further ensure structures in the standard image space are well preserved. Since in realistic, stripe-free LSFM barely exists with a standard image acquisition protocol, DeStripe is equipped with a Self2Self denoising loss term, enabling artifact elimination without access to stripe-free ground truth images. Competitive experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of DeStripe in recovering corrupted biomarkers in LSFM with both synthetic and real stripe artifacts.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are a class of generative models, showing superior performance as compared to other generative models in creating realistic images when trained on natural image datasets. We introduce DISPR, a diffusion-based model for solving the inverse problem of three-dimensional (3D) cell shape prediction from two-dimensional (2D) single cell microscopy images. Using the 2D microscopy image as a prior, DISPR is conditioned to predict realistic 3D shape reconstructions. To showcase the applicability of DISPR as a data augmentation tool in a feature-based single cell classification task, we extract morphological features from the cells grouped into six highly imbalanced classes. Adding features from predictions of DISPR to the three minority classes improved the macro F1 score from $F1_\\text{macro} = 55.2 \\pm 4.6\\%$ to $F1_\\text{macro} = 72.2 \\pm 4.9\\%$. With our method being the first to employ a diffusion-based model in this context, we demonstrate that diffusion models can be applied to inverse problems in 3D, and that they learn to reconstruct 3D shapes with realistic morphological features from 2D microscopy images.",

    "abstract": "napari 0.4.16 <pre><code class=\"lang-{note}\">These are the preliminary release notes for 0.4.16 release candidates. The final release notes will be posted with the release on 2022-05-31. </code></pre> We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.4.16! napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy). For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website. File Opening Changes in 0.4.16 Prior to <code>npe2</code>, file opening with plugins worked through a cascade of function calls trying different readers until one worked, or all failed, in which case an error would be raised. Preferences for readers could be set by reordering hook implementations in the Call Order preference dialog. This behavior was slow, confusing, and often led to unexpected results. You can see more discussion on this in issue #4000. <code>npe2</code> supports readers declaring a list of accepted filename patterns, and PR #3799 added a dialog for users to select a plugin to read their file (if more than one was available), and save a preference for that file extension. Before removing plugin call order, we want to make sure that file opening behavior across the GUI and command line is predictable, reproducible and explicit. After discussion in #4102, #4111 and this zulip thread, we decided that as a guiding principle, calling <code>viewer.open</code> should not infer a plugin choice for you, and any inference behavior should be opt in. This has led to the following API and GUI changes <code>builtins</code> is now the default value for the <code>plugin</code> argument in <code>viewer.open</code>. This means you should <strong>always</strong> explicitly pass a plugin to <code>viewer.open</code>, if you don't want to use <code>builtins</code> (and we encourage you to pass the argument anyway). To specify a plugin in a Python script: <pre><code class=\"lang-python\"> import napari viewer = napari.Viewer() viewer.open('my-path.tif') # this will throw MultipleReaderError if napari_tifffile is installed as both it and builtins could open the file viewer.open('my-path.tif', plugin='napari_tifffile') # this won't </code></pre> <code>viewer.open</code> will <strong>not</strong> inspect your file extension preferences, and will not choose among available plugins if you wish to opt into the \"gui-like\" behavior where your preferences are respected and we infer a plugin if just one is compatible with your file path, you must explicitly use <code>plugin=None</code> To opt into plugin inference behavior: <pre><code class=\"lang-python\"> import napari viewer = napari.Viewer() viewer.open('my-path.nd2', plugin=None) </code></pre> If multiple plugins could read your file, you will see a <code>MultipleReaderError</code> A preferred reader missing from current plugins will trigger a warning, but the preference will be otherwise ignored A preferred reader failing to read your file will result in an error e.g. if you saved <code>napari_tifffile</code> as a preference for TIFFs but then tried to open a broken file To save a preference for a file pattern in Python, use: <pre><code class=\"lang-python\"> from napari.settings import get_settings get_settings().plugins.extension2reader['*.tif'] = 'napari_tifffile' get_settings().plugins.extension2reader['*.zarr'] = 'napari-ome-zarr' </code></pre> When opening a file through a GUI pathway (drag &amp; drop, File -&gt; Open, Open Sample) with no preferences saved, you are provided with a dialog allowing you to choose among the various plugins that are compatible with your file This dialog also allows you to save a preference for files and folders with extensions This dialog also pops up if a preferred reader fails to open your file This dialog does not pop up if only one plugin can open your file Running <code>napari path</code> in the shell will also provide the reader dialog. You can still pass through a plugin choice, or layer keyword arguments To specify a plugin at the command line, use: <pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">napari my-path.tif --plugin napari_tifffile </code></pre> Preference saving for file reading is now supported for filename patterns accepted by <code>npe2</code> readers, rather than strictly file extensions Existing preferences for file extensions will be automatically updated e.g. <code>.tif</code> will become <code>*.tif</code> Reader preferences for filename patterns can be saved in the GUI via the preference dialog Reader preferences for folders are not yet supported in the GUI preference dialog - use the Python method above This will be addressed by the next release We have thought carefully about these choices, but there are still some open questions to address, and features to implement. Some of these are captured across the issues listed below, and we'd love to hear any feedback you have about the new behavior! How can we support selecting an individual reader within plugins that offer multiple #4391 If two plugins can read a file, and one is builtins, should we use the other plugin as it's likely more bespoke #4389 Provide a way to \"force\" the reader dialog to open regardless of saved preferences #4388 Add filename pattern support for folders npe2 #155 Highlights Added sphinx-gallery (#4288) Add NAP process for major proposals (#4299) Add ColorEncoding privately with tests (#4357) Implement <code>TextManager</code> with <code>StringEncoding</code> (#4198) Add NAP1: institutional and funding partners (#4446) New Features Add alt-text to nbscreenshot output HTML images (#3825) Support of transformation parameters for the interaction box (#4301) Add function to show error in notification manager (#4369) Improvements Faster 2D shape layer creation (#3867) Npe2 enable/disable support (#4086) Use QFormLayout for layer control grid (#4195) Implement <code>TextManager</code> with <code>StringEncoding</code> (#4198) Add size argument to Viewer.screenshot() (#4201) fix error message when no reader available (#4254) Allow remote .tiff files to be loaded (#4284) refactor shape resizing logic and bugfix for #4262 (#4291) Accept None for scale (#4295) Rewrite ellipse discretization from scratch (#4330) Add ColorEncoding privately with tests (#4357) Update TextManager benchmarks to use string/features (#4364) add is_diagonal utility and Transform property (#4370) Add points size slider tooltip.

    "abstract": "The <code>aicsimageio</code> v4.8.0 release includes three main groups of changes: <code>aicsimageio</code> now ships with mypy type annotations. If you are using mypy, our types can now be properly imported and type checked against. <code>aicsimageio</code> image containers and writer functions now have an <code>fs_kwargs</code> parameter to pass down any arguments for creating the <code>fsspec</code> Filesystem object with. i.e. <code>AICSImage(\"s3://some-bucket/some-image.ome.tiff\", fs_kwargs=dict(anon=True))</code> for anonymous / no credential S3 file reading. <code>BioformatsReader</code> bugfixes for scene management / switching and preparing the reader for the next release of the underlying <code>bioformats_jar</code> version. An additional minor package admin change has been added which runs our <code>aicsimageio</code> test suite multiple times a week but installs with our upstream dependencies <code>main</code> branches instead of released versions. This is so we can help catch bugs earlier in the release process rather than post release.
